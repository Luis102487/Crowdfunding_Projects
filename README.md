# Crowdfunding Data Analysis

For this project, I will be assuming the role of an analyst at an investment firm that invests in early stage entrepreneurs. I will analyze Kickstarter projects to understand factors that lead to a project taking off and provide data-driven recommendations for the types of projects the investment firm should be looking at for future success.

Data for 375,000+ Kickstarter projects from 2009-2017 is provided. This data includes project name, category, launch date, deadline, goal, amount pledged, number of backers, state, and country.
